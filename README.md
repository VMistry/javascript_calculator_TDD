# Calculator Homework
## Timings
45 - 90 minutes

### Tasks:
My task was to test out my Javascript Calculator application that has four settings, (b)asic, (a)dvanced, (i)bmi and (t)trip

#### Features for each calculator:-

##### Basic:
For the basic calculator, I had to test:
* Select correct operation to do the job - It should take in two number and an operation in a string. It should use the operation string to select the correct operation e.g. addition, subtraction, multiply or divide. It should return the correct answer.
* Addition - Should take in and add two numbers. Return the correct answer.
* Multiplication - Should take in and multiply two numbers. Return the correct answer.
* Division - Should take in and divide two numbers. Return the correct answer.
* Subtraction - Should take in and subtract two numbers. Return the correct answer.

##### Advanced:
For the advanced calculator, I had to test:
* Power - Should take in two numbers and make the first the power of the second. Return the correct answer.
* Square root - Should take in a numbers and square root it. Return the correct answer.

##### BMI Calculator:
Calculate the BMI when given the height and weight - the user should be able to choose between the imperial and the metric system.

##### Trip Calculator
This feature asks the user for four inputs; distance, fuel efficiency (mpg), cost per gallon, speed and it will give you the time and price of your journey.

##### Example output:
"Your trip will take 3.5 hours and cost Â£255.33.""

Note: For every 1 MPH over 60 MPH, reduce the the MPG by 2 MPG (i.e. a car that normally gets 30 mpg would only get 28 mpg if its speed were 61 mph. Yes this gets silly at high speed where mpg goes to zero or gets negative - how will you handle this?)

##### Hints
Get user input - var hello = prompt("What is your name?")
Output to console - console.log("Hello Sparta")

##### Deliverables
Must meet DOF (Definition of Done)
Must use Functions (DRY - Dont repeat yourself)
Deliver code via link to pull request in Teams to Rich and Anthony
